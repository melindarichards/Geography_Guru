Are You a Geography Guru?

This is a timed quiz featuring multiple-choice questions about obscure geography facts.

The player is allowed to pick one and only one answer to each question.

A countdown timer shows the time remaining to finish the quiz. 

The game ends when the time runs out, at which point the page reveals the number of questions that were answered correctly and incorrectly.
